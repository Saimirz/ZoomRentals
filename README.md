# ZoomRentals


This is the back-end of zoom rentals.

To create this back-end intellij Ultimate was used. I created a database which hold car, renter, and account tables which display your informtation and the cars
that are actaully available to rent. The reason why intelliJ Ultimate was used was because it offers many shortcuts and also has it's own H2Database and can extend the Crud Repository.
Overall, IntelliJ Ultimate makes everything more convenient and a smoother creation.

The way it works that in the different Controllers you can make requests to the methods you have defined which will actually get, update, delete or create data. Through this
you can then create a front-end which will be able to recieve data from the back-end. It also provides you with a place to be able to save data and create it.

At first it was very confusing and difficult to actually implement all the needed methods and requests. a lot of things didn't work and were broken. but in the end i was able to figure it out and 
get it to work.
